            <p><img src="joylynn-selfie.JPG" width="300" alt="selfie of joylynn while on a train"></p>
            <p>Hi, my name is Joylynn! I am 22 years old and live in Maple Valley, WA. One of my passions is editing and shooting video creation because I love telling stories or creating creative moments. I also love hanging out with my friends, sodas, trying new restaurants to find unique places to eat, I have also begun to branch out into eating various foods that have cultures. This has now become one of my passions because it is involved with good people and adventure. I also really enjoy traveling and checking out new places, and while I do not enjoy the plane rides, the destination usually makes it worth the travel. I love taking pictures and video of my trips so that I can share and remember those moments. And lastly, music has a lot to do with my life too. I have a strong love for music; it helps me unwind, helps me to be inspired, and it helps keep me motivated.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>1. One of the most significant things I gained from this course is how to construct a basic HTML website. Prior to the course, I didn't have any experience with HTML whatsoever. So to be able to create a simple webpage with structure and color is something that makes me proud.</p>
            <p>2. I also learned how to modify my elements' styles directly in the text, giving me more control over what I want the appearance of my site to look like.</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, I learned how to add colors and fonts into my work. This made my pages feel more personal and creative, and it was interesting to see how design decisions could allow a website to be more appealing.</p>
