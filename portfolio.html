            <p><img src="RESUME.png" width="300" alt="word that spells out resume project one on an image"></p>
            <p>This is one of our first projects that we had to do for this class. I remember thinking at the time that this was the hardest thing I have ever done for a project. Then next week, it was an even more harder assignment and this felt like a breeze. I remember finally getting the structure of how to make a HTML site by doing this Resume project, and when the keys started to flow, it was really satisfying seeing what I made.</p>

            <p><img src="my-top-5.png" width="300" alt="word that spells out my top 5 and project 2"></p>
            <p>This project was relatively easy for me. The concepts were easy to grasp and I was able to play around with my favorite colors. I enjoyed making this project because it felt just like the resume project. It was repetitve in a good way. It helped me remember all the tags and what order they all go in. This is where we learned about floating. It was hard at first but I watched the video like 3 times and I was able to get it. </p>

            <p><img src="fav-city.png" width="300" alt="word that spells out fav city and project 3"></p>
            <p>This project was a little harder. There were really no videos to go off of. I just started to look back on my previous work and used what I learned from those projects to make this one. I feel like there were a lot of elements in this project, I didn't really care for the color scheme. Overall, proud of how it turned out even of how frustrated I was.</p>

            <p >This project was a lot for me. I was having a really hard time with how much single elements were needed for this project however, I was able to get the bare minimum on the page which I was really proud of. It may not look as pretty as the other ones I have done, but Im just glad I was able to push through. I practiced more on how to wrap the text with the images. We also touched on flex box, which I also used on this page if you look at the menu buttons on the top of this page. </p>

            <p>This lab was one of the first things I had to do in this class. I found it fun since it had a step by step which really helped me put an action to a name. This really helped me understand the concepts.</p>
